## Approach taken 

The first thing I did was make classes for my wizard and dog and give them methods to heal themselves receive damnage 

Following that I visualied about ten curtains standing in single file line. once you pull a curtain the previous one is gone and you can now see the most present one. I tooke that same apporach with my code using addd event listeners to simply change the display upon clicking events

## What I could have done better

Glancing at my code it could've been shortened significantly if I just make a universal methods for changing the scene. I spook with a few peers and they agreed using a single method for this class and also accessing the id using an array could also be helpful in shortening my code.
